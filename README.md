![GoodDeeds](public/images/gooddeedslogo.png)

## Welcome to our Final Project with the University of Pennsylvania LPS Coding [Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.sas.upenn.edu/).

- To begin we recommend that you checkout our [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pO-N2DIgKoBmlrJ0XbjlgqDsIfM6vazRnIX6vr50us4/edit?usp=sharing) prior to running our application !

- Next you will want to request api keys from:
  Event brite API | Google Maps API | Charity Navigator API

* After you have optained the API keys, make a git clone of our repository.

* Run npm i to download the node modules

* Run the command mongod in your root terminal, do the same with mongo to launch your server.

* Run npm start in the GOODDEEDS root folder to launch our application.

* ENJOY!!!

## Our team is continuing to develop our application, if you encounter any issues please let us know.

### We would love to get you a pitcher of beer, hangout and talk about coding sometime :)

## Our Mission & Motivation for Development

Concept: The idea for the application came from trying to teach my daughter the importance of helping others in our community and how to get started “doing good deeds”. While trying to search for a local charity we found ourselves reviewing 100 different links, websites, and reviews. There had to be a better way to do this ...

Many of us are not aware of what charities are in our area, and what events they host. GoodDeeds was created to address this as a one-stop app that makes it easier for everyone to find where to donate their time, money, and efforts in helping others and improving their communities.

## Our Plans for Future Development

- Add sidebar for advertisements (App monetization)
- Implementation of a “donate” button using a payment request API to allow users to donate from the app to their prefered charities i.e recurring monthly donations. such as (paypal or venmo)
- Social experience. Allowing users to “follow” other gooddeeders, leave comments, reviews, and suggest.
- Rewards systems (similar to leveling up) to encourage users to continue doing good deeds!
- Enable functionality for giving donations, becoming a donor, charity fundraising, and becoming a volunteer.
- Creation of a detailed page for each charity using the API.
- The creation of a “backdoor” mode where charities can log in and control their content.
- Fully built app through heroku deployment
- Creation of categories (i.e children support, religious, disaster relief) and suggestions based on previous Good Deeds of the user for future Good Deeds.
- Full app built in React.

## Website will be gifted to a caring cause that supports our Good Deeds Values
